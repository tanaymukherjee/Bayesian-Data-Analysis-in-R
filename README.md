# Bayesian-Data-Analysis-in-R

Questions we are trying to answer through bayesian mothod of dustribution:

Question 1) Build a Bayesian model that answers the question: What would the rate of sign-up be if method A was used on a larger number of people?

Question 2) Whatâ€™s the probability that method A is better than telemarketing?

Question 3) If method A was used on 100 people what would be number of sign-ups?

This is an exact replication of bayesian model as learnt from Rasmus Baath's blog and you-tube channel

For understanding Bayesian model follow the following 3 videos. It can't get easier and more cohorent for first timers. He shares examples to exercises also for our practice.
